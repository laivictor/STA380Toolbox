## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

curve(dnorm(x),
      xlim = c(-3.5, 3.5),
      ylab = "Density", 
      main = "Standard Normal Density Function") 
```

```{r}

x=rnorm(100)
hist(x,probability=TRUE,col=gray(.9),main="normal mu=0,sigma=1")
curve(dnorm(x),add=T)
```
